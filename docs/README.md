## 🌟 What is Starlin?

Starlin is a lightweight framework that combines the best concepts of modern web development (file-based routing, API routes, component-based UI) into a package that is stripped of complex configurations and compilation steps.

It is explicitly designed to be **AI-Friendly**. Its consistent structure and "Convention over Configuration" approach make it trivial for LLMs (like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to generate entire features without getting lost in boilerplate.

## 📚 Documentation

- [**Getting Started**](./GETTING_STARTED.md) - How to install and build your first Starlin app.
- [**Architecture**](./ARCHITECTURE.md) - How Starlin works under the hood (now with VDOM!).
- [**Comparison**](./COMPARISON.md) - Starlin vs React/Next.js.
- [**Roadmap & Reality Check**](./ROADMAP.md) - What's missing and what's coming next.

## ✨ Key Features (v0.0.2)

- ✅ **File-Based Routing**: Just like Next.js. `src/pages/about.js` -> `/about`.
- ✅ **Auto-API Endpoints**: `src/api/users.js` -> `/api/users`.
- ✅ **Virtual DOM Rendering**: Smart diffing algorithm updates only what changed. No more `innerHTML` wipes! focus is preserved.
- ✅ **Error Overlay**: Runtime errors pop up instantly in a beautiful dark-mode overlay.
- ✅ **Reactive State**: Simple proxy-based state management that triggers smart re-renders.
- ✅ **Zero Config**: It just works out of the box.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is a **v0.0.2** release created for educational and experimental purposes. It is getting closer to being usable for real prototypes! Please read the [Roadmap](./ROADMAP.md) for details.
