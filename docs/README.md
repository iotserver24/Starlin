## 🌟 What is Starlin?

Starlin is a lightweight framework that combines the best concepts of modern web development (file-based routing, API routes, component-based UI) into a package that is stripped of complex configurations and compilation steps.

It is explicitly designed to be **AI-Friendly**. Its consistent structure and "Convention over Configuration" approach make it trivial for LLMs (like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to generate entire features without getting lost in boilerplate.

## 📚 Documentation

- [**Getting Started**](./GETTING_STARTED.md) - How to install and build your first Starlin app.
- [**Architecture**](./ARCHITECTURE.md) - How Starlin works under the hood.
- [**Comparison**](./COMPARISON.md) - Starlin vs React/Next.js.
- [**Roadmap & Reality Check**](./ROADMAP.md) - What's missing and what's coming next.

## ✨ Key Features (v0.0.1)

- ✅ **File-Based Routing**: Just like Next.js. Create `src/pages/about.js` and it works at `/about`.
- ✅ **Auto-API Endpoints**: Create `src/api/users.js` and it becomes `/api/users`.
- ✅ **Reactive State**: Simple, proxy-based state management.
- ✅ **Component System**: Functional components using template literals.
- ✅ **Zero Config**: It just works out of the box.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is a **v0.0.1** release created for educational and experimental purposes. It is **NOT** production-ready. Please read the [Roadmap](./ROADMAP.md) for a detailed breakdown of limitations.
